# Maji Ndogo Data Analysis

## Overview

This project is a **multi-part Power BI analysis** of socio-economic, water service, and safety-related data for **Maji Ndogo**.

### Part 1 & Part 2 (Merged)

The current version combines **Part 1 and Part 2**, focusing on exploratory and descriptive analysis through interactive visualisations to identify patterns and trends.

The analysis includes:

* Population distribution (rural vs. urban)
* Water source types and usage
* Queue time patterns by day and hour
* Queue composition by gender and age
* Well pollution status
* Water-source-related crime by type, gender, time, and location

* **Shared taps and wells** serve most residents, contributing to longer queue times.
* Queue times are **highest in the early morning and evening**, especially on **weekends**.
* Larger queue sizes are generally associated with **longer waiting times**, indicating capacity constraints.
* A notable number of wells are **chemically or biologically contaminated**, posing health risks.
* **Women and girls** are disproportionately affected by water-source-related crime.
* **Harassment and assault** are the most frequently reported crime types near water sources.
* Crime incidents tend to occur more often during **early morning and late evening hours**.
